                <h2 id="post-8-2" className="blog-post-title">8.2: Orbit the Main Character</h2>

                <p>Every secondary character should orbit a main character, otherwise it's worth asking whether they should be in the story.</p>
                <p>Less important characters should be introduced only as necessary. For instance, if a character attends school, you need to depict teachers and other students, but if school isn’t a major setting, they don’t need as much attention and should only behave and be described in ways which say something about the important characters. In other words, it’s a bit like the main characters are planets and the side characters are moons which orbit around them. The behavior of side characters should be designated by the character arc or trajectory of – where do you want your main characters to go and how will the side characters help/hinder them? What do you want to say about your main characters and how will that description be communicated (expressly or by conduct) by the side characters? Side characters are like the wheels of a car, or the oil that lubricates the wheels; whereas main characters are the passengers (the plot is the driver). When the bus stops, the wheels stop and are forgotten, and it’s the passengers who get off and arrive at the destination.</p>
                <p>You should avoid having your side characters say things heavily charged with emotion (joy, fear, anger, lust). It's not going to have a meaningful effect because side characters do not have arcs, so you have provided no build-up for their reaction. Therefore, worst of all, the spontaneity may in fact be taken for comedy.</p>

                <h2 id="post-8-3" className="blog-post-title">8.3: Fire Some Extras</h2>

                <p> Every side character must serve an individual purpose. If your protagonist has a group of friends, every single member of that group must serve a separate function in the story – and not ‘the female friend,’ ‘the black friend,’ ‘the gay friend,’ etc. If your protagonist only needs one friend, then give them only one friend.</p>

                <h2 id="post-8-4" className="blog-post-title">8.4: The Perfect Friend</h2>

<p>Fiction writing has a cliché about protagonists having ‘perfect’ friends. These are either the ‘people you wish were your friends’ or the sycophantic lapdogs of the protagonist. </p>
<p>The role of the first kind is to liven up the protagonist’s life, introducing the protagonist to interesting new people, places and activities. The best friend is always ‘up to 11,’ cheerful, adventurous, hilarious and a little crazy. It’s that person who goads the protagonist to try new things because ‘why not?’ The protagonist wishes they were this person.</p>
<p>The role of the second kind is to trumpet the glories of the protagonist, to pick up the protagonist when they’re down and doubtful; provide the shoulder to cry on, defend the protagonist’s honour no matter. They are fiercely loyal, humble, generous, and generally well-adjusted. This person wishes they were the protagonist.</p>
<p>You want to avoid writing either of these characters. Going by writing standards, these characters are far from perfect. </p>
<p>The problem is these characters don’t challenge your protagonist in any way. Best friend characters should put your protagonist in situations which expose aspects of your protagonist, but not necessarily gratify them. Characters should disagree and compromise.</p>

<h2 id="post-8-5" className="blog-post-title">8.5: Idiosyncratic Characters</h2>

<h5>(1) Children</h5>

<p>In most respects, older children and adolescents are easier to write than adults (like less complex adult characters), however, very young child characters and toddlers are harder to write than adult characters (like autistic or mentally scrambled adults);</p>

<p>In general, children don’t make good characters, because: </p>

<ol>
  <li>
  Their identities, likes, dislikes, interests and goals are still forming, so you lack a fully defined character. Little you can say about your character that can’t be taken with a grain of salt, as it may change (even drastically) once they grow up;
  </li>
  <li>
  Because a child has their whole life ahead of them, it’s going to be difficult to conclude their arcs without sounding inconsequential and artificial;
  </li>
  <li>
  Children lack the autonomy of adults, so much of what happens in your child character’s life is going to be directed by their adult carers, and make it harder to plot events;
  </li>
  <li>
  Children’s relationships with each other lack the depth and subtext;
  </li>
  <li>
  Children tend to be bad liars and struggle with cognitive dissonance, which ousts most subtext from your writing; 
  </li>
  <li>•	Children are not ‘normal’ characters, which means they have a selective role to play in a story, like any character with a special trait or characteristic. </li>
</ol>

<p>In order to deal with the above drawbacks, you must externalize a child character’s arc. No grappling with intense mental conflict. The more inside your character’s head the story is, the older they must be. This means anything but the archplot is forbidden, and you’ll find 90% of novels with children protagonists are archplots.</p><a href="#f1"><sup>10</sup></a>

<u> But see Alice in Wonderland</u>

<p>Another way around is to infuse a ‘the child is the father of the man’ theme, showing how childhood incidents predisposed someone’s adult character. However, this does not make the child a protagonist, but a flashback, anecdote or memory which guides, develops and contextualizes the adult protagonist’s present action.</p>

<h6>I. Child Dialogue</h6>

<p>If you're writing children's dialogue you need to note that children – particularly young children – speak differently than adults. They have a less sophisticated grasp of English than adults, and less developed linguistic ability. Some basic points:</p>

<span className='bold-text-span'> (1) Self-absorption: </span> A child's world is more self-centred than an adult's. This is due to a greater ratio of self-knowledge (feelings, impulses) compared to knowledge about the broader world. I.e. less developed theory of mind; children know what they want but don't have a very good ability to predict what others are like, or want. This is reflected in the way children's speech revolves around themselves as the subject. 

<p>Compare these examples of both an adult and child communicating that the dog is to be walked:</p>

<p className='indent-text-1'>Adult: "The dog needs a walk."</p>
<p className='indent-text-1'>Child: "I want to walk the dog."</p>

<p>This communicates the child wouldn't know whether the dog 'needs' a walk, or 'wants' a walk (because of a less developed theory of mind). There is only whether the child wants or does not want to take the dog on a walk. By contrast, notice that the child's dialogue lays itself explicit, while the adult's implies something: that the adult does not want to take the dog for a walk; so it must be someone else’s job. </p>

<p><span className='bold-text-span'> (2) Lying: </span> Young children aren’t as good at lying as adults. Fidgeting, broken eye contact, speaking slowly and hollowly are all signs which tend to betray young children who try to lie (moreso to an adult, and where the possibility exists that they might be in trouble);</p> 

<p><span className='bold-text-span'> (3) Uncertainty: </span> A child's world contains less certainty; a lot of things happen for reasons children can't explain. Adults seem to make up rules as they go and know things children can't fathom. For this reason, children can tend to phrase their speech in more questions ("Can I...?" "Will she...?") and once they can learn to speak, children (generally) ask an adult for permission to do almost anything. Even when children make statements, they may act as if they are silently asking for an adult’s input, e.g. they may speak more loudly than necessary, as if giving the adult every opportunity to reply.</p> 

<p><span className='bold-text-span'> (4) Perception of Time: </span> A child's perception of time is more immediate. Children who really want to assert something will draw upon past experiences to back up their assertions (It happened on Monday, and it happened on Tuesday, so it has to happen today as well). Children will predominantly speak in present tense ("I'm hungry"), and then past tense (“yesterday at school the teacher told me…”) and very little future tense (because a child shouldn’t be able to predict the future very well).</p> 

<p><span className='bold-text-span'> (5) Punctuation: </span> A lack of punctuation and structure is a big indicator of childlike speech, for example run-on sentences. This is partly owing to a child’s weaker grasp of causative links which would allow speech to flow linearly and neatly, and has their speech end up with an ‘everything-and-the-kitchen-sink’ sound. Also, an adult’s more sophisticated grasp of causation allows their speech to be truncated to imply causative links. </p> 

<h2 id="post-8-6" className="blog-post-title">8.6: The Role Model</h2>

<p>If a character has to do something unusual or unthinkable, it's good to have a character who serves as a 'role model'; someone who has done something similar, whose purpose it is to show the main character that it's possible.</p>

<p>You see these archetypified – even stereotyped – mostly in high fantasy, which has the ‘wise old mentor’ character. The wise old mentor doesn’t even have to have done the plot action previously; merely because they say the plot action is possible for the protagonist to achieve, we believe it. This is a lazy way of going about it.</p>

<p>More clever would be to imply this by showing, rather than telling. That might mean the mentor is actually shown doing the thing, or practically forces the protagonist through it, each step of the way (e.g. Pet Sematary) or has information he/she could only have gotten from doing the thing previously (e.g. 11/22/63). </p>
