        This is a smaller sibling blog to my other site Fiction Map. It's a resource
        for writers looking to improve their craft and write scarier, better horror stories.

        Horror is a special genre. It is definable by what it does not possess:
        clear plot goals, antagonists, positive themes, tidy resolutions, and happy endings.

        If a reader is left with an overall sense of dread, confusion, bewilderment and upset, according
        to other genres, the story is a failure...
      </p>
      <p className='portfolio-bio'> ...Except for horror, where this is the goal.</p>

      <p className='portfolio-bio'>Special storytelling rules apply, which are covered in this blog. I hope you find it useful! </p>
