# Description <a name="description"></a>

A fullstack MERN blog. My blog provides an in-depth guide on fiction and narrative writing. It runs front-end in React, on an Express server, with Node.js. There are 25+ pages each covering a separate topic on writing, including plot, dialogue, characters, conflict, theme, settings, etc. The back-end has a Mongodb database, and graphql queries, and enables user registration for basic account access, user authentication by JWT. Users can leave comments on each page, and contact me via a working contact form on the contact page (to do).

This is a personal project that has been probably 10 or so years in the making, including accumulation of 113,000 words worth of writing advice from various published sources, as well as the piles of fiction I've read. Examples are also sourced from non-fiction which uses narrative-style writing.

The aim was to create a comprehensive guide for fiction-writing, compiling all the good advice I've found in various helpful how-to-write guides all in one single place. It includes advice on fiction-writing, screenwriting, and even improv acting guides.

It cites professional advice, techniques, and examples, examples. The guide assumes the user knows nothing about fiction-writing and explains concepts in depth.
